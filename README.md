    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/array-dtypes
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var dtypes = require( '@stdlib/array-dtypes' );
```

#### dtypes( \[kind] )

Returns a list of array data types.

```javascript
var out = dtypes();
// e.g., returns [ 'float32', 'float64', ... ]
```

When not provided a data type "kind", the function returns an array containing the following data types:

-   `float32`: single-precision floating-point numbers.
-   `float64`: double-precision floating-point numbers.
-   `complex64`: single-precision complex floating-point numbers.
-   `complex128`: double-precision complex floating-point numbers.
-   `bool`: boolean values.
-   `generic`: values of any type.
-   `int16`: signed 16-bit integers.
-   `int32`: signed 32-bit integers.
-   `int8`: signed 8-bit integers.
-   `uint16`: unsigned 16-bit integers.
-   `uint32`: unsigned 32-bit integers.
-   `uint8`: unsigned 8-bit integers.
-   `uint8c`: unsigned clamped 8-bit integers.

To return the subset of data types belonging to a specified data type kind, provide a `kind` argument.

```javascript
var out = dtypes( 'floating_point' );
// returns [...]
```

The function supports the following data type kinds:

-   `floating_point`: floating-point data types.
-   `real_floating_point`: real-valued floating-point data types.
-   `complex_floating_point`: complex-valued floating-point data types.
-   `boolean`: boolean data types.
-   `integer`: integer data types.
-   `signed_integer`: signed integer data types.
-   `unsigned_integer`: unsigned integer data types.
-   `real`: real-valued data types.
-   `numeric`: numeric data types.
-   `typed`: typed data types.
-   `all`: all data types.

Additionally, the function supports extending the "kinds" listed above by appending an `_and_generic` suffix to the kind name (e.g., `real_and_generic`).

```javascript
var out = dtypes( 'floating_point_and_generic' );
// returns [...]
```
